## Disclaimer ⚠️

While we strive to provide a vast and entertaining collection of riddles, it's important to note that CHATGPT, the technology powering RiddleMeThis, might occasionally "hallucinate" answers or generate riddles that have been previously created. This means that:

- Some answers validated by CHATGPT might not align with traditional solutions, due to the model's creative interpretation of data.
- The riddles presented might resemble those from existing collections, as CHATGPT draws upon a vast dataset of information, including commonly known riddles.

We believe these instances add to the charm and unpredictability of RiddleMeThis, encouraging users to think outside the box and embrace a broad interpretation of potential answers.
