You have fifteen trays, each of which can make a dozen cubes, but if you stand one tray on top of another before it's frozen, it will sink into the lower tray and you won't get full cubes from the lower tray. Without using anything but water and the ice cube trays, what is the fastest way to make full ice cubes in seven trays?",
        "answer": "This can be accomplished by using frozen cubes as spacers to hold the trays apart. In the time it takes to freeze two trays, seven trays of ice can be frozen. Fill one tray, freeze it and remove the cubes. Place two cubes in the opposite corners of six trays, and fill the rest with water. Freeze all six trays, plus the seventh tray which is on top."

Was it homicide or suicide and how do you know?",

If it was really a suicide, the recorder should have still been running and a police officer would have had to stop and rewind the cassette. Because someone (the murderer) had already stopped and rewinded the cassette so that the police officer just had to press play, it can be concluded that it was a homicide."

They were sitting there for a while, when a woman came by with five very valuable hats; three blue and two red. She put a hat on each man without telling them what color their hat was. Remember, they were strattling the bench, so each man could see what color hat the men or man in front of them had, but not the color of their own hat. So, the guy in back could see they middle and front guys' hat; the guy in the middle could see the front guy's hat, and the front guy could not see anyone's hat. The woman told the men that whoever could stand up and say the color of their own hat first would keep all the hats. The rules were simple: 1) You could not move your head. 2) You could not talk to anyone else. 3) You had to have proof of why you knew the color of your hat (to prove that you weren't just guessing). The men could not see the woman or the hats she was holding (and therefore had not given out). After about an hour of thinking, the man in front stood up and stated (correctly) that his hat was blue. How did he know this? (scroll down for a hint.)Hint: you do not have to find the color of everyone's hat; just the color of the front guy's hat.",
        "answer": "The front guy knew that he had a blue hat because if his hat was red, one of the other guys would have already knew the color of their hats. You see, if the middle guy's hat was blue, and the front guy's hat was red, the middle guy would have known that his hat was blue because if it were red, the back guy would would have seen that the only two red hats were taken, so he'd know his hat was blue. And if the middle guy's hat was red, as I previously stated, the back guy would would have seen that the only two red hats were taken, so he'd know his hat was blue.

A few minutes later, the clerk realizes he has made an error and overcharged the trio by $5. He asks the bellhop to return $5 to the 3 friends who had just checked in. The bellhop sees this as an opportunity to make $2 as he reasons that the three friends would have a tough time dividing $5 evenly among them; so he decides to  tell them that the clerk made a mistake of only $3, giving a dollar back to each of the friends. He pockets the leftover $2 and goes home for the day! Now, each of the three friends gets a dollar back, thus they each paid $9 for the room which is a total of $27 for the night. We know the bellhop pocketed $2 and adding that to the $27, you get $29, not $30 which was originally spent. Where did the other dollar go????",
